# Applicatives!

Lot's of applicative related code from my blog post What's Ap?

Fragments of this code appear in my Scala Love (2020 online conference) talk "What's Ap?"

This code doesn't do a lot on its own; the Scala files all compile and run but they are mostly illustrative samples from the blog post.
